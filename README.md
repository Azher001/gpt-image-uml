# Evaluating-GPT-Image-1-UML-Component-DIagram-Generation
This repository contains all materials used in our study on assessing the diagram-generation capabilities of GPT-Image-1 across multiple architectural settings.

codes/

Contains the complete source code used for:

    - Generating UML component diagrams from natural-language requirements
    - Running statistical tests (Friedman, Wilcoxon)

diagrams/

Includes all generated diagrams for every requirement across four architectural settings:

  - Style-agnostic
  
  - Layered architecture
  
  - Microservices architecture
  
  - Event-driven architecture
  
Each requirement has a corresponding set of four diagrams.

requirements/

Contains the textual requirements used as input for the diagram-generation study. The requirements are collected from the following existing work.

D. D. Bari, G. Garaccione, R. Coppola, M. Torchiano, and L. Ardito, “Evaluating large language models in exercises of UML class diagram modeling,” in Proceedings of the 18th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, ESEM 2024, Barcelona, Spain, October 24-25, 2024, X. Franch, M. Daneva, S. Mart´ınez-Fern´andez, and L. Quaranta, Eds. ACM, 2024, pp. 393– 399.
