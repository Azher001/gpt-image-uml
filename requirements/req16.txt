OOBank

This system provides the basic services to manage bank accounts at a bank called OOBank. OOBank has many branches, each of which has an address and branch number. A client opens accounts at a branch. Each account is uniquely identified by an account number; it has a balance and a credit or overdraft limit. There are many types of accounts, including: a mortgage account (which has a property as collateral), a checking account, and a credit card account (which has an expiry date and can have secondary cards attached to it). It is possible to have a joint account (e.g. for a husband and wife). Each type of account has a particular interest rate, a monthly fee and a specific set of privileges (e.g. ability to write checks, insurance for purchases etc.). OOBank is divided into divisions and subdivisions (such as Planning, Investments and Consumer); the branches are considered subdivisions of the Consumer Division. Each division has a manager and a set of other employees. Each customer is assigned a particular employee as his or her ‘personal banker’.
