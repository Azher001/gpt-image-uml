Hollywood Approach

We are interested in building a software application to manage filmed scenes for realizing a movie, by following the so-called “Hollywood Approach”. Every scene is identified by a code (a string) and it is described by a text in natural language. Every scene is filmed from different positions (at least one), each of this is called a setup. Every setup is characterized by a code (a string) and a text in natural language where the photographic parameters are noted (e.g., aperture, exposure, focal length, filters, etc.). Note that a setup is related to a single scene. For every setup, several takes may be filmed (at least one). Every take is characterized by a (positive) natural number, a real number representing the number of meters of film that have been used for shooting the take, and the code (a string) of the reel where the film is stored. Note that a take is associated to a single setup. Scenes are divided into internals that are filmed in a theater, and externals that are filmed in a location and can either be “day scene” or “night scene”. Locations are characterized by a code (a string) and the address of the location, and a text describing them in natural language.
